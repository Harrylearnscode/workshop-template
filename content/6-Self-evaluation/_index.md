During my participation in the First Cloud Journey program from **8/9/2025** to **[end date]**, I had the opportunity to learn about cloud technologies and apply what I learned to various projects.
I explored AWS services and joined workshops, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of Cloud. Additionally, I had the chance to connect with more people.

In terms of work ethics, I always strive to complete my tasks well, follow the rules, and actively communicate with teammates to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect my internship progress, I have conducted a self-evaluation based on the criteria below:
