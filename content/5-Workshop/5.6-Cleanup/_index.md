Congratulations on completing this workshop! 
In this workshop, you learned architecture patterns for building Serverless Event-driven applications on AWS.

By configuring S3 Event Notifications, you enabled an automated workflow where compute resources (AWS Lambda) react instantly to data ingestion without the need for manual intervention or server management.

By integrating Amazon Polly, you successfully leveraged Managed AI Services to transform text into lifelike speech, demonstrating how to add complex machine learning capabilities to your application with minimal code.
