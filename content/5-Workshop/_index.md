# Automated Text-to-Speech Converter using Serverless

#### Overview

**Event-Driven Architecture** allows you to build applications that automatically respond to changes in state, such as a file upload, without provisioning or managing servers.

In this lab, you will learn how to create, configure, and test a Serverless pipeline that automatically converts text files into lifelike speech audio using AWS Managed Services.

You will utilize two key mechanisms to process data asynchronously:
+ **S3 Event Notifications** - Configure Amazon S3 to act as an event source. It will automatically trigger a compute function whenever a new object is uploaded to a specific input folder.
+ **Managed AI Services** - Leverage Amazon Polly to synthesize speech from text. This allows you to add deep learning capabilities to your application through simple API calls, without needing data science expertise.
