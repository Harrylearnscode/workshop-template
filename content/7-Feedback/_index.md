> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is fun and friendly. Members at FCJ are always ready to support me whenever I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and airy.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor always helps our group and encourages everyone to ask questions.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The program introduced completely new knowledge to me. It helped me better understand my own gaps so I can supplement my knowledge before graduation.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I gained more knowledge about cloud technologies. At the same time, I improved my teamwork skills and professional communication in a corporate environment. Additionally, I realized my lack of experience in managing software development processes. Furthermore, the mentor supported me in learning new knowledge.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone is polite and works seriously. People support each other in their tasks.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers flexible working hours and regularly organizes workshops to help interns build their knowledge.

### Additional Questions
##### What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship?
- Everyone is friendly and supportive. The mentors are enthusiastic.  
##### What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?
- Since the program does not include interviews during selection and emphasizes self-discipline throughout the internship, the company should add assessments to check interns’ knowledge and learning progress. Also, frequent small quizzes would help prevent FPTU students from seeking external help just to pass. 
##### If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why or why not?
- If my friends plan to pursue cloud, DevOps, etc., I would recommend this program.
